The similar idea is discussed in [this research paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280490924_Mobile_self-checkout_systems_in_the_FMCG_retail_sector_A_comparison_analysis)\r\n\r\nIt would be so great if you could <mark style=\"background: #D2B3FFA6;\">identify the arguments</mark> and advantages for this step <mark style=\"background: #D2B3FFA6;\">from other sources,</mark> proving that Karzinka can benefit from it. \r\n\r\nIn short, the general structure is the following (of course, you can also add your own solutions, but overall recommendation is *to support them with external academic sources)* :  \r\n\r\n> According to (source authors), *bla-bla-bla* has successfully worked out, showing (result of the implementation), and thats why Karzinka might as well benefit from integration of the *bla-bla-bla* by doing *bla-bla-bla*\r\n\r\nYou can use in-text citations and proper referencing using [this book](https://www.westminster.ac.uk/sites/default/public-files/general-documents/Referencing%20Your%20Work%20booklet_06.1.pdf)\r\n\r\nAdditionally, in my response to Question #2, I also mention a few study cases with some statistical results and where (company or place) the case has taken place , and you may also refer to those justifications. \r\n\r\nOn top of that, I have earlier send a detail document on the solution that we have chosen with the group (the self-checkout) - that's basically a summary of a related research paper. You may also want to go over it. \r\n\r\nThank you very much üôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèª",

R automatically converts between integer and numeric types in calculations\r\n   - Logical values convert to 1 (TRUE) or 0 (FALSE) in numeric operations\r\n   - The \"wider\" type usually prevails (e.g., integer + numeric = numeric)\r\n\r\n5. **Value vs Type Comparison**\r\n   ```r\r\n   5L == 5     # TRUE (comparing values)\r\n   typeof(5L) == typeof(5)  # FALSE (comparing types: \"integer\" vs \"double\")\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n6. **Type Hierarchy**\r\n   - character > numeric > integer > logical\r\n   - When mixing types, R usually converts to the higher type\r\n   ```r\r\n   1L + 2.5    # Result is numeric (2.5 wins)\r\n   TRUE + 1L   # Result is integer (1L wins)\r\n   TRUE + 1.0  # Result is numeric (1.0 wins)\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n## R Objects and Assignment\r\n### Variable Assignment Examples\r\n```r\r\n# Basic assignment\r\nage <- 25\r\nname <- \"Alice\"\r\n\r\n# Multiple assignments\r\nheight <- weight <- 70\r\n\r\n# Complex assignments\r\nbmi <- weight / (height/100)^2\r\n\r\n# Listing objects\r\nls()                 # Shows all objects in environment\r\n\r\n# Removing objects\r\nrm(age)              # Removes single object\r\nrm(list = ls())      # Removes all objects\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Naming Conventions Examples\r\n```r\r\n# Valid names\r\nvalid_name <- 1\r\nvalidName <- 2\r\nVALID_NAME <- 3\r\n.hidden_name <- 4\r\n\r\n# Invalid names (will cause errors)\r\n# 1name <- 5      # Can't start with number\r\n# _name <- 6      # Can't start with underscore\r\n# name-1 <- 7     # Can't use hyphen\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n**Practice Exercises:**\r\n7. Create variables of different types and test their classes\r\n8. Perform arithmetic operations with variables\r\n9. Try working with missing values and understand their behavior\r\n10. Practice naming conventions and object assignments\r\n\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\n[[R data type and packages]] -> the continuation of the R chronicles (Week 2)\r\n\r\nR programming tutorial -> A 2 hours-long video tutorial\r\n![R Programming Tutorial](https://youtu.be/_V8eKsto3Ug?si=7OytJRUDdxaItPdh)",
